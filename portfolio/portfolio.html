        <p><em><span>University Project</span></em><span>. We build three different java apps using the game Robocode to apply some knowledge of AI. We wrote an A* algorithm to solve a random generate map, a genetic algorithm to improve the skill of a tank, and a neural network to predict the output of the battles before the actual battle. </span><a href='https://github.com/adrisalas/roboCode2019' target="_blank"><span>Github Link</span></a><span> </span></p>

        <p><em><span>University Project &amp; not finished product</span></em><span> In this app I worked with 4 international students (1 Greek, 2 Polish, 1 Korean) to design and start developing a social benefit application. Our idea was to build an &quot;online shelter&quot; to help animals. We developed the backend in java and learned how to work using Test Driven Development (TDD) and SCRUM methodology. We did mock-ups of the GUI in Android Studio and HTML/CSS/JavaScript but the only part we &quot;finished&quot; was the business logic in Java. </span><a href='https://github.com/adrisalas/PetsApp'><span>Github Link</span></a><span> </span></p>

        <p><em><span>University Project.</span></em><span> A desktop app that given a number of iterations it will start generating the bitwise operation of two different sequence of random bits. Two different threads are generating the bits of the Sequence 1 and Sequence 2 meanwhile a third thread is doing the bitwise operation and upgrading the progress bar. </span><a href='https://github.com/adrisalas/Bitwise-AND-SwingWorker' target="_blank"><span>Github Link</span></a><span> </span> </p>

        <p><span>During my years at the university I wanted to stand out as much as possible when I started looking for work. For this I decided to make this webpage that you are seeing. The most remarkable thing was that I designed and anti-spam filter for bots generating my email encoded by JavaScript and that you can check my portfolio easily. </span><a href='https://github.com/adrisalas/adrisalas.github.io' target="_blank"><span>Github Link</span></a><span> | </span><a href='https://www.salastroya.com' target="_blank"><span>Web Link</span></a><span> </span></p>

        <p><span>This is the first webpage I built.

Apart from simply using the template, I customized several parts of the code because I didn&#39;t like some effects and actions. </span><a href='https://github.com/adrisalas/old-website' target="_blank"><span>Github Link</span></a><span> | </span><a href='https://www.salastroya.com/old-website' target="_blank"><span>Web Link</span></a><span> </span></p>

        <p><em><span>University Project.</span></em><span> This is a two player game, this is supposed to be connected to bigger buttons and leds, in order to create a a game similar to &quot;simon game&quot;. Each player needs to press his/her button when one of his leds turns on. Each time the time-frame to press the button is smaller, so you need to be fast. If you press the button when it is not your turn you loose. </span><a href='https://github.com/adrisalas/raspberryPi2Game2018' target="_blank"><span>Github Link</span></a></p>

        <p><span>I collaborated with an industrial engineer for the creation of a desktop application that allowed you to modify a 3D piece previously designed in OpenSCAD. This app makes use of CMD, so despite being made in java it only works on windows and need a 2014 or 2015 OpenSCAD installation. </span><em><span>I do not have permission to publish images of the app on the internet, if you want more info contact me by email.</span></em></p>

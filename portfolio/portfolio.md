## AI in Robocode

`Java` 

_University Project_. We build three different java apps using the game Robocode to apply some knowledge of AI. We wrote an A* algorithm to solve a random generate map, a genetic algorithm to improve the skill of a tank, and a neural network to predict the output of the battles before the actual battle.

## PetsApp

`Java` `UML` `SCRUM` `TDD`

_University Project & not finished product_ In this app I worked with 4 international students (1 Greek, 2 Polish, 1 Korean) to design and start developing a social benefit application. Our idea was to build an "online shelter" to help animals. We developed the backend in java and learned how to work using Test Driven Development (TDD) and SCRUM methodology. We did mock-ups of the GUI in Android Studio and HTML/CSS/JavaScript but the only part we "finished" was the business logic in Java. [Github Link](https://github.com/adrisalas/PetsApp)

## Bitwise Random Generator with Threads

`Java` `Java Swing`

_University Project._ A desktop app that given a number of iterations it will start generating the bitwise operation of two different sequence of random bits. Two different threads are generating the bits of the Sequence 1 and Sequence 2 meanwhile a third thread is doing the bitwise operation and upgrading the progress bar.

## This website :smile:

`HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript` `Markdown` 

During my years at the university I wanted to stand out as much as possible when I started looking for work. For this I decided to make this webpage that you are seeing. The most remarkable thing was that I designed and anti-spam filter for bots generating my email encoded by JavaScript and that you can check my portfolio easily.

## Website from Template

`HTML` `CSS` `JavaScript` `W3.CSS`

This is the first webpage I built. I used a w3schools template and customized it to my liking in order to familiarize myself with frontend _(which is not taught in my university)_. Apart from simply using the template, I customized several parts of the code because I didn't like some effects and actions.

## Raspberry Pi 2 - Game LED 

`Assembly` `ARM` 

_University Project._ This is a two player game, this is supposed to be connected to bigger buttons and leds, in order to create a a game similar to "simon game". Each player needs to press his/her button when one of his leds turns on. Each time the time-frame to press the button is smaller, so you need to be fast. If you press the button when it is not your turn you loose. [Github Link](https://github.com/adrisalas/raspberryPi2Game2018)

## Desktop App to generate OpenSCAD

`Java` `Java Swing` `OpenSCAD`

I collaborated with an industrial engineer for the creation of a desktop application that allowed you to modify a 3D piece previously designed in OpenSCAD. This app makes use of CMD, so despite being made in java it only works on windows and need a 2014 or 2015 OpenSCAD installation. _I do not have permission to publish images of the app on the internet, if you want more info contact me by email._

        <p><code>2017 - 2021</code></p>
        <p><span>I have obtained </span><strong><span>two Honours</span></strong><span> (maximum qualification). 30% of the </span><strong><span>courses taken in English</span></strong><span> (Data Structures, Algorithms, Databases, OOP...). In most of my university projects I have been the one in charge of </span><strong><span>distributing work, organizing, taking decisions</span></strong><span> and </span><strong><span>exposing</span></strong><span> presentations. I&#39;m in love with the tech field, and this was the best Bachelor&#39;s degree I could have taken.</span></p>

        <p><code>2014 - 2017</code></p>
        <p><em><span>Not finished</span></em><span>. Although I didn&#39;t finish it and I have no intention of finishing it, I learned a lot about other engineering areas. Studying this Bachelor contributed a lot to me in the way of doing my job, I have quite solid engineering process fundamentals. Due to my knowledge in the different engineering fields I am able to collaborate with these areas of Engineering easily.</span></p>

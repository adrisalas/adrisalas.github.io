#### Bachelor in Software Engineering

`2017 - 2021`

I have obtained **two Honours** (maximum qualification). 30% of the **courses taken in English** (Data Structures, Algorithms, Databases, OOP...). In  most of my university projects I have been the one in charge of **distributing work, organizing, taking decisions** and **exposing** presentations. I'm in love with the tech field, and this was the best Bachelor's degree I could have taken.

#### Bachelor in Electronics, Robotics and Mechatronics Engineering

`2014 - 2017`

_Not finished_. Although I didn't finish it and I have no intention of finishing it, I learned a lot about other engineering areas. Studying this Bachelor contributed a lot to me in the way of doing my job, I have quite solid engineering process fundamentals. Due to my knowledge in the different engineering fields I am able to collaborate with these areas of Engineering easily.

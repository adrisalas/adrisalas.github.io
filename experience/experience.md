#### Programming Tutor

`SEPT 2018 - NOW`

I teach fundamentals of programming in Python, C++ and Java. Also I teach concurrent programming and MVC in Java. All my students are happy with the way I approach them to understanding the concepts of programming and the way to think how to solve the problems step by step.
